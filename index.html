                <p>American styles of furniture have a few things in common: solid wood furniture with distinctive grains and stunning finishes are future heirlooms; live-edge metal, stone, and leather blend rich and rustic. This Bassett look, known as American Artisan, has a unique, handcrafted feel.</p>

                <h3>Vintage</h3>
                <p>Younger than antique furniture, vintage furniture is usually between 50 and 100 years old and is often purchased used. While people often throw around the terms “vintage” and “old” interchangeably, the word "vintage" can suggest more of an artistic flair embracing nostalgia for older time periods.</p>
